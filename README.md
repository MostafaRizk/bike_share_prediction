# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## Overview

A project I completed in fulfilment of the requirements for the AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Udacity. The end-goal of the project is to submit a model to a kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand). The objective of the competition is to predict daily demand for bikes in a bike-sharing business.

The project involves: 
* Using AutoGluon (an AutoML library) to build and train an initial set of models
* Improving the score by pre-processing the dataset using Pandas
* Further improving the score by tuning the AutoGluon hyperparameters
* Implementing this entire workflow in AWS SageMaker
* Submitting the model to Kaggle

The project consists of the following files:
* [Jupyter notebook](project/project.ipynb) with code run to completion
* [HTML export](project/project.html) of the jupyter notebbook
* [Markdown](project/report.md) of the report

### Dependencies

```
Python 3.8
MXNet 1.9
Pandas >= 1.2.4
AutoGluon 0.2.0 
```
